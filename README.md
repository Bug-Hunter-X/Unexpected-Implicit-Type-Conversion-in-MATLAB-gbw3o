This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in MATLAB related to implicit type conversion.  The bug arises from a comparison between a numeric variable and a string variable which may lead to unexpected logical outcomes. The solution involves explicit type checking or conversion to prevent unintended behavior.  Refer to the bug.m and bugSolution.m files for details and solutions.
